Smart Blind Stick – Assistive Navigation System

This project presents an assistive Smart Blind Stick designed to support visually impaired users by providing real-time feedback about obstacles and environmental conditions. The system uses ultrasonic sensors, vibration actuators, a buzzer, and environmental monitoring (temperature and light level) to ensure safe navigation. The implementation is built on Arduino and fully simulated on Tinkercad.
